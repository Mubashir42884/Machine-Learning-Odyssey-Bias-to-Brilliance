    "In machine learning, our goal is often to find the best parameters (weights and biases) for a model that accurately predicts outcomes.  This involves **minimizing a \"cost function\"** which measures how poorly our model is performing. Gradient Descent is a powerful and widely used **iterative algorithm that helps us find the minimum of this cost function**.  It works by taking small, calculated steps downhill along the cost function's surface, guided by the gradient (slope) at each point.\n",

    "</br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is this approach so effective?\n",
    "Gradient Descent is preferred because it's a relatively simple yet efficient way to **find the minimum of complex functions**, even when analytical solutions are impossible.  It's applicable in a wide range of machine learning models, including *linear regression, logistic regression, and neural networks*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Where to use Gradient Descent? How does it helps?\n",
    "Specifically in **cost calculations**, gradient descent helps us find the parameters that **minimize the difference between our model's predictions and the actual values**, leading to a better fit.  Gradient Descent is typically employed when we have a **differentiable cost function and need to optimize model parameters**, making it a cornerstone of many machine learning algorithms."
